# Day 02 – Mock SOC Analyst Internship

## Focus Area
Understanding authentication logs and attacker behavior.

## What I did
- Learned about Windows logon types
- Studied how attackers move laterally inside networks
- Reviewed examples of privilege escalation

## What I learned
- Logon Type 3 indicates network-based logins
- Lateral movement allows attackers to access multiple systems
- Privilege escalation increases attacker control

## Why this matters in a SOC
- SOC analysts must identify suspicious logins
- Early detection can stop full network compromise

## Skills Practiced
- Log analysis thinking
- Attack chain awareness
- Defensive security mindset
